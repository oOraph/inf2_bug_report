We are having troubles spawning inference service hosting the meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct model in containers hosted on inf2.48xlarge

Observed on inf2 48xlarge instances running containers with all the neuron devices attached to them 

The container feels frozen and unresponsive. Killing the container take ages (did not try to kill it directly, I let kubelet + containerd do their job, but the grace period set for the k8s pod was 30 s and the containerd sandbox stayed there for far longer)... The attached dmesg stack trace then appears, definitely showing that something unusual happens on the node

When we observe this the neurons are not in use in the container (they are just attached), for example we can have it by executing a container in which all we do is calling sth like the following script

```
import os
os.environ["HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER"] = "1"

from huggingface_hub import HfApi


api = HfApi(token=os.environ.get("YOUR_TOKEN"))
# Download the repository to the workdir and filter out non-framework specific weights
api.snapshot_download(
    "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct",
    local_dir="/repository",
)

```


Container is like frozen
